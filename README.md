# Game of Life

This is for reliving the moment of a course work during my first year in university. The task was to create a basic illustration of John Conway's [“Game of Life”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). In this work, I added a few more features to it, especially the real-time editing to make it more interesting. Also, I took the chance to practise some React Redux to control the settings of the game.
